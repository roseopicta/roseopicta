## ðŸª´ About me

I am a M.Sc. (M2) student in Sorbonne UniversitÃ©'s Quantum Information programme. In addition to all things quantum, I love playing with FPGAs, SDR platforms, and microcontrollers. In my spare time, I grow plants and follow the coolest bands in town.

## ðŸŒŸ Recent projects

* ðŸš§ Multimode cluster states. The covariance matrix reconstruction code used for some of my simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/roseopicta/phase_scan).
* [Reservoir computing with multimode squeezed states](https://github.com/EQ15T/optical_qrc). Code for the simulations and benchmarks of the paper "Experimental memory control in continuous variable optical quantum reservoir computing" [arXiv:2506.07279v1 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07279).
* [Multimode, multiphoton state preparation](https://github.com/EQ15T/photon-catalysis). Code for the paper "Photon catalysis for general multimode multi-photon quantum state preparation" [arXiv:2507.19397 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19397).
* Optimization of the DSP chain of a CV-QKD receiver. I reworked the carrier and symbol timing recovery bits of [QOSST's "Bob" (receiver)](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-bob/tree/dev) module and came up with several other computational optimizations.
