## About me

I am a MSc (M2) student in Sorbonne UniversitÃ©'s Quantum Information programme. In addition to all things quantum, I love playing with FPGAs, SDR platforms, and microcontrollers. In my spare time, I care for my plants and follow the coolest bands in town.

## M1 Projects

### Multimode, multiphoton state preparation

[Code](https://github.com/EQ15T/photon-catalysis) for the paper "Photon catalysis for general multimode multi-photon quantum state preparation" [arXiv:2507.19397 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19397).

### Reservoir computing with multimode squeezed states

[Code](https://github.com/EQ15T/optical_qrc) for the simulations and benchmarks of the paper "Experimental memory control in continuous variable optical quantum reservoir computing" [arXiv:2506.07279v1 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07279).

The covariance matrix reconstruction code used for some of my simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/roseopicta/phase_scan).

### Optimization of the DSP chain of a CV-QKD receiver.

I reworked the carrier and symbol timing recovery bits of [QOSST's "Bob" (receiver)](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-bob/tree/dev) module and came up with several other computational optimizations.

### FPGA-accelerated CV-QKD transmitter
